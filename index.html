    <h2>My Letter To You 💌</h2>
    <p class="letter">
      My dearest love,<br><br>
     Happy 4 months with you, my darling.

I still find myself in awe every single day — that someone as wonderful as you exists… 
and that I get to call you mine.

You are patient, persevering, gentle, understanding, endlessly loving, caring, talented, intelligent, adorable — everything 
I could’ve ever dreamed of in a partner. But beyond all those traits, it’s your heart that captivates me most. The way you love — deeply, 
wholeheartedly, and without holding back — it moves me.

There have been times I gave you a hard time. Moments when I was clouded with emotions, unsure of how to love rightly. And yet, 
even then, you stayed. You understood me when I didn’t even understand myself. You gave me grace when I couldn’t ask for it. That is something I will never 
forget — the way you choose me again and again, especially when it isn’t easy.

Your love doesn’t come with conditions. It comes with arms wide open, with softness in every word you speak, and 
warmth in every message you send. You wrap me in comfort, even from miles away.

I feel so unbelievably cherished when I’m with you.

You make me feel like the most loved woman in the world.

Your presence — even in the form of a simple “wyd” — never fails to brighten up my day. The way you call me your baby, 
the way you giggle and laugh with me, the way you make space for me in your everyday life — it means the world. I carry those little moments with me like treasures, 
and they’ve become part of the joy I live in now.

I admire you deeply. Your honesty, your openness, the way you pour out your heart so freely to me — it's rare and beautiful. You’ve shown me a kind of love that doesn’t 
run when things get hard. Instead, you stay. You work through the mess. You hold my hand through the storm. 
And you do it all while reminding me how much I’m loved.

Sure, we’ve had our ups and downs. But those moments aren’t marks of weakness — they’re signs that we’re real, that we’re growing, that we’re building something rooted and strong. 
And I know, without a doubt, that we’re becoming better together.

I want to grow with you — in love, in faith, in life. I want to keep learning how to love you better every day, to become the kind of partner you deserve. 
Because you, my love, deserve nothing less than the very best of me.

Thank you for loving me. Thank you for choosing me.

I can’t wait to spend not just more months, but many years — a lifetime — with you.

You make me feel like the luckiest woman alive.

I love you, endlessly.

Forever yours,
      Love always,<br>
      Cai
